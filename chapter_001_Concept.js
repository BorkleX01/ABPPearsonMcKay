        "transcript":'Welcome to microbiology! The facts you’ll learn in this course are central to healthcare today. But science facts aren’t the only thing you need to know in order to succeed in your future job. What I mean is this: Five or ten years into your career, patient outcomes will depend on your understanding many concepts that aren’t featured in this textbook or class—that’s because they aren’t yet known!<br><br>New diseases constantly emerge, and research evolves, creating new best practices and treatments. In this rapidly shifting world, it’s as essential to know how to assess the facts as it is to know the facts themselves. In other words, you must be able to think critically, and apply that process clinically, so patients benefit.<br><br>But thinking clinically and critically takes a lot of practice to develop. So my book provides many opportunities for that. One example is the case studies. These clinical scenarios feature patients and care providers—they’re designed to give you an opportunity to apply what you’re learning to a realistic situation. Answering questions about the case studies is both fun and challenging. <br><br>My book contains at least two clinical case studies per chapter. There is a clinical case that starts on the first page of each chapter—these are videos with question sets. You can view them online, in Mastering, or via QR codes with your phone. You’ll also see a SMART case and related questions printed at the end of the chapter. The SMART cases serve as a comprehensive capstone for microbiology concepts discussed in that particular chapter.<br><br>Critical thinking is always a rigorous process. So over years of teaching thousands of allied health students, I’ve developed a framework that helps students tackle cases studies with more success and confidence. I call my approach the SMART framework. SMART stands for summarize what’s known and unknown; make connections between related details; avoid distractors in the case study; re-read the case and other chapter material; and thoroughly answer the questions at hand.<br><br>Let’s walk through each of these steps a bit more. <br><br>The “S” in SMART reminds you to begin by summarizing case information. Some details necessary for answering questions are in the case study itself, but other key information may appear in the chapter. So use the full chapter and case together. And as in real life, a case study may not contain every detail you’d like to know about a patient or the given scenario. So note the known facts, as well as any important unknowns too. You may find it helpful to organize your thinking in a table similar to the one shown here. <br><br>The “M” in SMART reminds you to make connections between information in the case study and your greater knowledge on the subject, which comes from what you may already know about the topic, as well as what you learned through your chapter readings and in class. Making connections lets you leverage facts to greater effect.  For example, the SMART case -in chapter 1 asks you to offer an evolutionary explanation as to why a particular blood type is rarely found in an area where cholera has been common since ancient times. The case itself does not discuss how evolution and cholera relate. However, in chapter 1, there is a section covering malaria’s impact on human evolution. By recalling the malaria section and applying what you learned there to cholera, you can begin to propose a possible answer to the case study question.<br><br>Avoiding distractors is also crucial. Every detail provided may not be necessary, and not all unknowns need to be known to solve the case! Stay focused on just the information that relates to the questions.<br><br>The “R” in SMART reminds you to re-read the case and the questions to make sure you didn’t miss anything. This step might sound unimportant, but with complex scenarios, it’s easy to miss important details among those noted distractors. So remember to re-read the case and the question to make sure you have all the necessary facts organized and that you are actually addressing the question.<br><br>Finally, you’ve arrived at the last SMART step, thoroughly and thoughtfully answering the question. Now that you’ve organized all the information regarding the case with the previous steps, you can apply logic and begin writing your answers. Before you complete the questions, be sure to recheck that you are providing exactly what each requested.<br><br>As you make your way through this course and your future career remember to think “SMART” when solving higher-order problems. One day you’ll be called upon to answer questions that aren’t explicitly defined in a book. You’ll need to integrate information quickly and accurately, with a lot more than a grade at stake. I want you to practice this skill now, before a life is on the line, so that you’ll become an integral part of tomorrow’s healthcare team. <br><br>I’m Dr. Lourdes Norman-McKay, and I hope you enjoy the journey.'
