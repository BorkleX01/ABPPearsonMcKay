        "transcript":'The Case of the Spreading Superbug. How can we track and prevent the spread of a deadly bacterium from an isolation ward? Part 1.<br><br>Problem solving and critical thinking are crucial skills to learn along your way to becoming a healthcare professional. Following the SMART steps outlined in your textbook can help you unravel this case study efficiently and effectively. Here’s a quick refresher on the SMART process:<br><br>First, summarize what you know and do not know about the patient and his or her problem. Next, make connections between related facts. Avoid distractors—that’s information that likely has no bearing on the illness. Re-read all your notes on the case details to ensure you haven’t missed anything. Finally, thoroughly answer the questions about the case.<br><br>Elizabeth was coughing up some bloody mucus and having difficulty breathing, so she went to her local hospital in New York. A long-time smoker, the 61-year-old had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or COPD. The lung disease made it difficult to recover from even a simple cold, and she’d landed in the hospital a few times over the past several years. This time doctors performed some basic tests and cultures to identify the underlying problem. Elizabeth anxiously awaited the results with her husband.<br><br>When she saw the expression on the doctor’s face, Elizabeth knew it was something even more serious this time. The doctor said her cultures grew carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, known as KPC. This type of bacterium is a part of the normal skin microbiota in about one-third of people.<br><br>Unfortunately, some of Elizabeth’s skin bacteria must have made its way into her lungs, and due to her COPD, established an infection. KPC infections are very serious because the bacterium is resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate is usually over 30 percent and can approach 100 percent in patients with weak immune systems.<br><br>While they initially admitted Elizabeth, the New York hospital decided that the serious nature of her infection called for a transfer to a facility with even stricter protocols for limiting the spread to others. They sent Elizabeth to the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health, in Maryland. It is one of the best hospitals in the nation and has high-level isolation wards that could help keep her infection contained while treating it.<br><br> At the National Institutes of Health hospital in Maryland, things improved dramatically for Elizabeth. Doctors cured her pneumonia and kept the KPC at bay. It was not easy, though. Elizabeth spent over a month in isolation to ensure the KPC did not infect other patients. She had to be treated with colistin, an older, toxic antibiotic considered a drug of last resort. The side effects had been terrible: persistent upset stomach, tingling fingers, dizziness, and itchiness all over her body. And Elizabeth remained colonized with KPC. If she were ever to be hospitalized again for any reason, she would have to tell doctors about her condition, which would then result in her being placed in isolation as a safety precaution. Despite that, when she was discharged in early July, Elizabeth and her family agreed there was much to celebrate as she headed home to New York.<br><br> Meanwhile, elsewhere in Maryland that same summer, a man named John was having a rough year.<br><br>As he sat at his computer staring at a stack of unpaid bills and reviewing the year’s intermittent income, he became more and more stressed. John decided to search the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center’s website to see if there were any medical studies in which he could participate to make some extra money. One study caught his eye: it needed volunteers with diabetes who had a history of alcohol abuse—two diseases John had been fighting for the past several years. The study required a three-week stay in the hospital, but it paid $1,500! He volunteered immediately.<br><br>A few weeks later, John arrived at the Clinical Center. Study participants stayed in a hospital wing far from where patients with infectious diseases were housed. Unfortunately, after the first week, John became sick and complained of difficulty breathing. The doctors ran tests and were shocked to find out John was infected with KPC. Worse, he was not the only one; another patient on a different floor was also infected. <br><br> KPC is a relatively rare condition, and, given its serious nature, hospitals track cases carefully. Because John and the other patient didn’t have lung infections when they entered the Clinical Center, doctors knew this was a hospital-acquired outbreak.<br><br>The only patient they’d recently had in the hospital with KPC was Elizabeth—but she’d been discharged weeks before. How could this have happened?'

        "transcript":'The Case of the Spreading Superbug. Part 2.<br><br>Things at the Clinical Center went from bad to worse. Since John’s infection, another case was appearing about every week. In total, there were seven confirmed cases of KPC so far. This happened despite the involvement of the hospital infection control team, which was rechecking isolation procedures, handwashing protocols, and equipment sterilization procedures. It was a disaster.<br><br>The director of the Clinical Center held a meeting with the doctors and nurses involved. They had found no evidence of wrongdoing by staff members or patients, and all isolation protocols seemed to have been followed. The director asked for suggestions on how to proceed.<br><br>Dana, a head nurse with a master’s degree in epidemiology, suggested a genetic approach for tracking the spread. “We are pretty sure each of these cases can be traced back to an infection in a single patient,” she explained. “If that’s the case, then comparing KPC DNA in each infected patient could help us establish a timeline. Normally when a bacterium replicates its DNA during cell division, everything goes smoothly, and there are no differences between the parent and the daughter cells. But occasionally, a mutation occurs. So maybe we can look for new, small mutations—differences between the first and later samples—as a way to piece together a timeline for when each patient was infected.”<br><br>“So you’re saying we should look at the bacterial DNA from the original infection and then compare that to samples of every KPC infection since?” the director asked. “And that the more similar a sample is to the original DNA, the more likely that infection occurred soon after the original KPC infection?”<br><br>“Right,” said Dana. “Comparing the genetics of the KPC found in each patient will tell us if the cases are, in fact, related to each other. And, if they are all related, then the more genetic differences or mutations we spot between the first patient and a later one, the more likely the later patient got sick further on in the outbreak. Second, knowing the timeline might also give us important clues as to how this is spreading.”<br><br>“Great idea!” said the director. “I will call our collaborators at the Intramural Sequencing Center and get them to help us with this.”<br><br>Assuming Elizabeth was the original source, researchers analyzed the chromosomal (genomic) KPC DNA samples taken from Elizabeth’s skin and lungs during her treatment. This would be the data they compared everything else against.<br><br>The team next sequenced the genome of the bacteria causing the infections of the seven other patients, listed in the order their infections were discovered, as well as some control samples: two they knew should match Elizabeth’s, and one unrelated bacterium.<br><br>When the computer analyzed the data, if a section was a perfect genetic match for bacteria from Elizabeth’s skin, it was flagged in light blue. If the section of the genome was a perfect genetic match for bacteria from Elizabeth’s lung, it was flagged in dark blue.<br><br>If a particular section of the genome did not match either Elizabeth’s skin or lung bacteria, it was flagged in red. So, red sections in an otherwise light blue or dark blue block represent new mutations. If the entire genome was flagged green, that tells us the bacterium analyzed was completely unrelated to Elizabeth’s.<br><br>It took a while to get all of the systems and protocols in place, but finally the data started to roll in. Here is what was reported.<br><br>The team was pleased to see that the controls had worked perfectly. The negative control did not match Elizabeth’s bacteria at any section. Positive Control 1 completely matched Elizabeth’s skin sample, and Positive Control 2 perfectly matched her other lung sample. Now they were ready to interpret the rest of the data.'

Part 3.<br><br>Though the director was pleased with the progress made tracking the infection, she was shocked to see that bacteria from two different sources (Elizabeth’s lungs and her skin) had spread so far. By now, the total number of KPC cases at the hospital had grown to 15!<br><br>With evidence that the superbug came from a single patient, the hospital realized the bacteria were somehow evading all isolation procedures and spreading throughout the facility. They decided to decontaminate every room in the hospital with measures well beyond usual protocol. This included using a hydrogen peroxide vapor to sanitize whole rooms. They also replaced sink drains, since there are many biofilms that exist inside them, and staff suspected KPC might be in them too. Everyone also used disposable barrier protection whenever possible, continued washing hands frequently, and set aside certain equipment and team members who would treat only KPC-infected patients and no one else. <br><br>Finally, the team went over the latest incidence and mortality numbers for the outbreak. There were sixteen confirmed cases. Eleven patients died. Four of those who died did so due to the other diseases that brought them to the NIH in the first place, though the KPC couldn’t have improved their chances of survival.

Someone may not have followed the strict hand-washing or disposable barrier procedures. A commonly touched object—equipment, for instance—may have remained contaminated, spreading disease. Perhaps the sink drains secretly harbored and passed along the bacteria to new victims.
