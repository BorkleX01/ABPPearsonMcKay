Part one.<br><br>Following the SMART steps outlined in your textbook can help you unravel this case study efficiently and effectively.<br><br>Here’s a quick refresher on the SMART process:<br><br>First, summarize what you know and do not know about the patient and his or her problem. Next, make connections between related facts. Avoid distractors - that’s information that likely has no bearing on the illness. Re-read all your notes on the case details to ensure you haven’t missed anything. Finally, thoroughly answer the questions about the case.<br><br>In <i>The Case of the Drunk Nursing Student</i> you will:<br><ul><br>    <li>Identify conditions that favor fermentation over aerobic respiration.</li><br><li>Describe links between cellular metabolism and the patient’s signs/symptoms presented in this case.</li><br><li>Describe how normal microbiota contribute to health and disease.</li><br><li>Interpret data in order to determine the cause of a disease.</li><br>    <li>Propose a plan for identifying the cause of the illness based on laboratory data.</li><br></ul>Mollie felt a mixture of excitement and nervousness as she started her first day of nursing school.<br><br>A few hours after lunch at the cafeteria, she started to feel a little sick. When her mom called to see how her first day went,  Mollie complained that the spaghetti she ate must have been bad - she felt faint and nauseated. Her mother pointed out it was only a few hours since lunch, and usually food poisoning took longer than that.<br><br>Her mom wondered if it might just be first-day-of-school nerves. Mollie agreed her mother was probably right. Unfortunately, Mollie’s stomach problems persisted into the first four months of school.<br><br>Each day within about an hour of eating, she would feel nauseated, sleepy, and faint. If she overate at all, she would even vomit afterwards!<br><br>She managed to push her way through these issues while still succeeding at her classes, but she was more and more troubled by what might be wrong with her.<br><br>"Miss? Miss? Do you know where you are?"<br><br>"Uh... no," said Mollie, slowly, as her eyes tried to focus. She’d been walking to class ... what had happened? She couldn’t focus but realized she must be laying on the ground.<br><br>"My name is Michael. I am an EMT. You were found unconscious here on the sidewalk. How much alcohol have you had to drink today?"<br><br>"None," Mollie stammered. "I don’t drink!"<br><br>"I can smell the alcohol on your breath," said the EMT.<br><br>"And you’re slurring your words. I need you to be honest with me so we can treat you appropriately."<br><br>Struggling to get the words out, Mollie said, "I swear! I don’t drink at all!"<br><br>'

They explained to Mollie’s mother that her daughter’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) had been well over the 0.08 g/dL legal limit the entire time she was hospitalized.<br><br>Mollie’s mother stood up for her daughter. "She swears she didn’t drink, and I believe her," she told the doctors and nurses. "Mollie is very focused on her career and doesn’t want to do <i>anything</i> that would jeopardize it. And I cannot believe that she’s been drunk this whole time! It’s been over 12 hours since you found her - wouldn’t she have to keep drinking while here in order not to sober up? That hasn’t happened. What you’re telling me doesn’t make sense." <br><br>Considering how adamant both Mollie and her mother were, the doctors decided to place Mollie in isolation, search her belongings for alcohol (finding none), and monitor her for 24 hours.<br><br>To test her metabolic responses, she was given a large dose of glucose soon after the onset of isolation. Every 2 hours, her BAC was tested by breathalyzer, and her glucose levels were assessed through a blood draw. <br><br>These are Mollie’s BAC results. The plus sign indicates the times at which she was fed glucose, a sugar. Any abnormal results are flagged with an asterisk.

        "transcript":"When numbers are large, medical test results often express the things they measure with scientific notation.  When converting a number from the way it is usually written – known as standard notation -- into scientific notation, it’s important to follow these steps.<br>First, write down the first the first two digits of the number being converted and put a decimal point between them.  Note that If the third digit is five or greater, then you must round the second digit up.<br>For example, if the number you are converting is 144,216, then put a decimal between the 1 and 4, and then look at the 3rd digit of your original number.  It’s a 4, meaning you don’t need to round in this case.<br>Next, you write “times 10” after your decimal number.  <br>After that, refer back to your original number.  Count the number of places between where you paced the decimal point and the end of the original number.  In this example it’s 5 places from the end of the number to the decimal point.<br>Finally, write the number of places as a superscript of 10 in your converted number.<br>In our example, that means 144,216 becomes one point five times ten to the fifth power.<br>Once you understand the steps, it’s also easy to convert a numbers out of scientific notation into standard notation.<br>In this new example, let’s first look at the exponent of 10 in the number.  <br><br>Is it positive?  That means you'll be moving the decimal point to the right.<br>If it's negative, then you'll be moving the decimal point to the left.<br>Next, you move the decimal point the number of places the exponent indicates.<br> <br>Once you've moved the decimal point beyond the number at hand, you add zeros as placeholders for the remaining digits required.<br>In this example, ten to the 6th power means you move the decimal point six places to the right.  So two point three times ten to the sixth power converts to two billion, three hundred thousand.<br>While for this example, ten to the negative sixth power indicates you move the decimal six places to the left. So two point three time ten to negative sixth power converts to<br>point zero, zero, zero, zero zero two three.<br>",
