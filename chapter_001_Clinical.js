        "transcript":'The Case of the Mystery Pathogen: How can an infection evade identification? Part 1.<br><br> Problem solving and critical thinking are crucial skills to learn along your way to becoming a health care professional. Following the SMART steps outlined in your textbook can help you unravel this case study efficiently and effectively. Here’s a quick refresher on the SMART process. First, summarize what you know and do not know about the patient and his or her problem. Next, make connections between related facts. Avoid distractors--that’s information that likely has no bearing on the illness. Re-read all of your notes on the case details to ensure you haven’t missed anything. Finally, thoroughly answer the questions about the case. As with clinical situations in real life, not all of the information you’ll need to answer the questions will come directly from the case; you’ll need to rely on your background knowledge and the information in the chapters to be successful.<br><br>David, a twenty-year-old biology major, felt nervous as he sat on the paper-covered exam table. He’d visited his college health services clinic before and was always a bit uncomfortable waiting for the nurse practitioner to arrive, especially today. He kept looking at his hand and wondering about the nasty sore on it. Was it an infection? Cancer? Might they have to amputate? His mind raced as he thought of all the terrible possibilities.<br><br>The nurse practitioner arrived and introduced herself as Samantha. Seeing that David was nervous, she made small talk about school to set him at ease while examining his hand. David said his lesion had developed several months before. He kept it covered with a bandage and applied antibiotic ointment daily. While the lesion wasn’t getting any bigger, it also wasn’t healing. Samantha tried to narrow down causes. She asked if David had contact with any dangerous chemicals or might have been stung by an insect before the sore emerged. He said no. <br><br>The wound was red and swollen. When she gently touched its edge with her gloved hand, it felt hot compared to the skin around it, and David winced in pain. Samantha recognized these four signs--heat, pain, redness, and swelling--as the hallmarks of inflammation. And inflammation, she knew, indicated the lesion was likely due to some sort of infection. However, when asked if he’d experienced any other illnesses, fevers, or lesions elsewhere on his body, David said no. He was healthy, aside from the hand lesion.  Without further clues as to the cause, Samantha swabbed the fluid in the lesion. She explained that the key to finding the best treatment plan was to identify the causative pathogen, so she was sending the sample of pus out for testing at the microbiology lab. She was confident that some simple tests would reveal a pathogen that commonly causes this sort of sore. While bandaging his hand, she instructed David to practice good hand hygiene and advised him to continue keeping the lesion clean and covered. If it got worse, he should call the clinic immediately. Otherwise, he’d likely hear back from her within the week about test results.'

        "transcript":'The Case of the Mystery Pathogen. Part 2.<br><br> David’s test results surprised Samantha, the nurse practitioner who treated him at the health clinic. No pathogens were detected after simple staining, and the cultures had not grown anything either. Given the way the wound looked, she’d expected the microbiology lab would have identified some sort of bacterium. Samantha called David and explained that they still didn’t know the cause of his lesion. She referred him to the local hospital for more testing. Alarmed, David asked if it was cancer. Samantha said she didn’t think so, but that cancer, in addition to other rare viral and bacterial infections, should be considered and ruled out through more testing. She wanted to send him to an infectious disease specialist at the hospital because they would likely have a better idea of what was causing this and because they have access to a better-equipped lab. David wrote down the referral information and promised to make an appointment soon. Now he was really scared. His worst fears about his hand might be coming true.<br><br>Once again, David found himself sitting on a paper-covered exam table. The doctor immediately said it didn’t look like cancer. He pointed out the inflammation around the lesion and agreed with the nurse practitioner’s earlier thought that this was a sign of infection. David only had a moment to feel relieved because next the doctor said it looked like it might be an anthrax lesion! David let out a little yelp of alarm--he’d heard about anthrax on the news. It was a potential bioterrorism agent and a potentially deadly bacterial infection. If that’s what he had, could he be cured? The doctor clarified that he was referring to cutaneous anthrax, not the more serious pulmonary version of the disease that David was thinking about. Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the bacterium Bacillus anthracis infects the skin; fortunately it is curable with antibiotics. The doctor suggested that alternatively the wound may be caused by bacteria called Francisella. He went on to ask if David had been around any livestock or rabbits lately. Was he possibly a hunter? David laughed, explaining that he’d never been to a farm or gone hunting in his life. He did research on fish in the lab at school but didn’t deal with land-dwelling animals. The doctor finished up the appointment by taking new samples from David’s wound. He said he would order the same tests that were previously ordered by the nurse practitioner, plus some additional tests. Besides anthrax and Francisella, he’d have the lab look for acid-fast bacteria. Hopefully they’d have a better idea what caused the lesion soon.<br><br>The hospital microbiology lab began working on David’s samples as soon as they arrived. Technicians inoculated a blood agar tube and streaked nutrient agar plates in an attempt to grow any bacteria that might be present in the lesion. They performed simple and differential stains on the samples. Because they thought there was a good chance the cause was bacterial, they did a Gram stain and an acid-fast stain to learn more about the cells. Results from the stains came back within 24 hours, while culture results took a few weeks.<br><br>'

        "transcript":'The Case of the Mystery Pathogen. Part 3.<br><br>This time, the test results gave David’s doctor something to work with. One of the tests came back positive for the presence of acid-fast bacilli. These bacteria include Nocardia and Mycobacterium species--uncommon infections for college students in the United States, especially in the skin. Puzzled and hoping to narrow down the agent, the doctor called David to ask him some more questions. He explained to David that Nocardia bacteria tend to infect people with weakened immune systems. Was David on any drugs that might lower his immunity? And had he ever had an HIV test?<br><br>David said he took no medications. As for HIV testing, he was relieved to report that he’d been tested for that when donating blood a few months back. All his blood-donation screening tests had come back negative. The doctor was glad to hear this. He recalled that in their appointment, David mentioned doing some sort of research in his college lab. Did David’s studies involve bacteria or infectious diseases? David laughed at that. He’d hated microbiology when he’d taken it. No, he didn’t do anything related to diseases. He just worked with fish. "That’s it," said the doctor triumphantly. "I think I know what’s causing your lesion. It’s Mycobacterium marinum!" The doctor explained that Mycobacterium marinum was a slow-growing organism that survives at temperatures slightly below core body temperature--that’s why the lesions tend to show up on extremities. Cellularly, it is acid fast and doesn’t Gram stain well because of a thick, waxy layer of mycolic acid that prevents the Gram stain’s water-soluble dyes from getting in. Furthermore, it lives in marine environments, so someone who works with fish has a plausible way to come into contact with it. Everything fit the test results as well as David’s circumstances. The doctor was sure this had to be it. David was thrilled to hear that this infection was treatable with antibiotics. The doctor said he’d look up the correct medication and call it into David’s pharmacy shortly. Relief was in sight!<br><br>Within a few days of starting antibiotics, the inflammation and redness of David’s lesion began to subside. Soon the lesion also began to shrink in size. From that point on, David vowed he would always wear gloves when working with the fish and their tanks at school. He’d also wash his hands very well after doing any research to prevent any future mystery infections. <br><br>It took a few weeks for the confirmatory cultures to grow at room temperature, but the doctor’s hypothesis had been correct. The infection was Mycobacterium marinum. David must have had a small cut or scratch on his hand that allowed the bacteria to get past the natural defenses of the skin and establish infection. The doctor had never seen this particular infection before. He vowed to be extra attentive when taking patient histories in the future. This case proved that any little detail provided by a patient could end up being important!'
