Part 1.<br><br> Problem solving and critical thinking are crucial skills to learn along your way to becoming a health care professional. Following the SMART steps outlined in your textbook can help you unravel this case study efficiently and effectively. Here’s a quick refresher on the SMART process. First, summarize what you know and do not know about the patient and his or her problem. Next, make connections between related facts. Avoid distractors--that’s information that likely has no bearing on the illness. Re-read all of your notes on the case details to ensure you haven’t missed anything. Finally, thoroughly answer the questions about the case. As with clinical situations in real life, not all of the information you’ll need to answer the questions will come directly from the case; you’ll need to rely on your background knowledge and the information in the chapters to be successful.<br><br>David, a twenty-year-old biology major, felt nervous as he sat on the paper-covered exam table. He’d visited his college health services clinic before and was always a bit uncomfortable waiting for the nurse practitioner to arrive, especially today. He kept looking at his hand and wondering about the nasty sore on it. Was it an infection? Cancer? Might they have to amputate? His mind raced as he thought of all the terrible possibilities.<br><br>The nurse practitioner arrived and introduced herself as Samantha. Seeing that David was nervous, she made small talk about school to set him at ease while examining his hand. David said his lesion had developed several months before. He kept it covered with a bandage and applied antibiotic ointment daily. While the lesion wasn’t getting any bigger, it also wasn’t healing. Samantha tried to narrow down causes. She asked if David had contact with any dangerous chemicals or might have been stung by an insect before the sore emerged. He said no. <br><br>The wound was red and swollen. When she gently touched its edge with her gloved hand, it felt hot compared to the skin around it, and David winced in pain. Samantha recognized these four signs--heat, pain, redness, and swelling--as the hallmarks of inflammation. And inflammation, she knew, indicated the lesion was likely due to some sort of infection. However, when asked if he’d experienced any other illnesses, fevers, or lesions elsewhere on his body, David said no. He was healthy, aside from the hand lesion. Without further clues as to the cause, Samantha swabbed the fluid in the lesion. She explained that the key to finding the best treatment plan was to identify the causative pathogen, so she was sending the sample of pus out for testing at the microbiology lab. She was confident that some simple tests would reveal a pathogen that commonly causes this sort of sore. While bandaging his hand, she instructed David to practice good hand hygiene and advised him to continue keeping the lesion clean and covered. If it got worse, he should call the clinic immediately. Otherwise, he’d likely hear back from her within the week about test results.</div>
