        "transcript":'The Case of the Confused Cattle Farmer: How can killer proteins replicate themselves? Part 1.<br><br> Problem solving and critical thinking are crucial skills to learn along your way to becoming a health care professional. Following the SMART steps outlined in your textbook can help you unravel this case study efficiently and effectively. Here’s a quick refresher on the SMART process. First, summarize what you know and do not know about the patient and his or her problem. Next, make connections between related facts. Avoid distractors--that’s information that likely has no bearing on the illness. Re-read all of your notes on the case details to ensure you haven’t missed anything. Finally, thoroughly answer the questions about the case. As with clinical situations in real life, not all of the information you’ll need to answer the questions will come directly from the case; you’ll need to rely on your background knowledge and the information in the chapters to be successful. <br><br>Donald had spent his whole life on a farm raising cattle. It was more than just a job. But at 64 years old, he had begun the process of transferring ownership of his farm to someone else. Fortunately, Donald’s grandson, Michael, had shown great interest and promise in running the day-to-day operations. Over the past month of working closely with Donald on the farm, Michael had noticed some worrying changes in his grandfather. Donald had some trouble walking, his vision suddenly diminished, and he experienced a lot of memory slips. Plus Donald just seemed grumpier overall. At first, Michael chalked this all up to a normal aging process, but as he thought more about it, the changes seemed to have come on too fast for that. He decided it was time to take his grandfather to the doctor. <br><br>Michael, his father, and Donald met with their family doctor. The doctor listened to Michael’s concerns and, in fact, saw some of the changes in Donald. She explained that these sorts of changes--especially when they come on rapidly--can be an indication that a patient has had a minor stroke that diminished blood flow to the brain. But other things can cause the same signs and symptoms too. As such, the doctor ordered an MRI of Donald’s brain and a blood draw to check white blood cell counts and other things that might alter brain function. One week later, the family met with the doctor again to discuss the results of the tests. Surprisingly, the radiologist reported everything came back negative. The doctor ordered a battery of other tests, explaining that other causes of Donald’s signs and symptoms might be a heart attack, infection, poisoning, or some other abnormality. Donald and his family were happy that it wasn’t a stroke but were very concerned at not having an answer or a plan. <br><br>When the farmhouse phone rang the next day, Michael dashed to answer it, hoping it was the doctor with good news. It was indeed the doctor, but the news was puzzling. All of Donald’s tests came back within normal range for a person his age. The doctor said that Donald’s mood, vision, movement, and memory signs and symptoms could be due to anything from stress at transitioning into retirement to the beginnings of Alzheimer’s disease. So she referred Donald to a neurologist for further evaluation. Despite a thorough workup by the neurologist, including an EEG and a lumbar puncture, nothing new was found. The doctor instructed Michael to try to keep Donald as relaxed as possible and to call if they noticed any changes.'

        "transcript":'The Case of the Confused Cattle Farmer. Part 2.<br><br>It had been two months since Michael first insisted that his grandfather, Donald, see the doctor due to some worrisome symptoms, including memory problems, diminished eyesight, and severe mood swings. Despite tests indicating that nothing was wrong, Donald’s signs and symptoms were actually worsening. At this point, his vision was nearly gone. His confusion was worse too: Some days he couldn’t even remember the names of his children! Most concerning, though, were the rapid physical changes. Donald’s work with cattle always kept him fit. But now, severe weakness of his arms and legs left Donald requiring a walker. He was also having some strange spasms and twitches. These involuntary movements were getting worse, pushing Michael to set up another appointment with the doctor. <br><br>The doctor was also very concerned with Donald’s fast decline. This time the doctor decided to hospitalize Donald for observation and testing. The hospital redid the previous tests for stroke, heart function, and infections but got the same negative results. Next, the doctor ordered a brain scan and an EEG to assess brain anatomy and function. While the brain scan looked normal, there were some abnormalities in the EEG: periodic sharp-wave complexes. These are indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease--the human version of mad cow disease. Donald was very scared when he heard the doctor had identified a brain infection. Michael told his grandfather not to worry; antibiotics could probably cure him. That’s when the news got even worse: The doctor explained that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was not caused by a bacterium or virus but instead by a misfolded protein. This protein grabs normal proteins in the brain and refolds them into the abnormal form, thereby replicating the infectious agent without DNA or any normal cell division processes. Even worse, the abnormal brain protein is so stable that it cannot be degraded, and its replication cannot be stopped by any medicines currently available. This was devastating news. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was a death sentence for Donald.'

        "transcript":'The Case of the Confused Cattle Farmer. Part 3.<br><br>Donald’s health continued to decline over the next few months. He became functionally blind, no longer walked, and lost control of most of his normal bodily functions. His memory rapidly worsened too. Eventually he didn’t recognize even Michael. It was incredibly difficult for the family to watch their formerly bright, active, and vibrant patriarch slip away. In the end, hospice care worked to keep Donald as comfortable as possible. Eventually Donald entered a coma and passed away shortly thereafter. The entire process, from the appearance of the first signs and symptoms to death, took less than one year. <br><br>During the autopsy, spongiform brain tissue was discovered, confirming the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. With this confirmation, the family had lots of questions and set up a meeting with the doctor. She explained that the disease is spread by the consumption of prions, proteins that are very difficult to degrade and that replicate themselves. All humans produce cellular prion protein in their brain. When we consume pathogenic prion proteins--a refolded version of our cellular prion protein--it is able to refold those normal brain proteins into the pathogenic form and cause disease. The doctor explained that Donald must have eaten an infected animal at some point in his life. This could have been a cow suffering from mad cow disease or a deer or elk suffering from chronic wasting disease. There are other sources of the prions, but based on Donald’s history these seemed the most likely. Presumptive diagnosis, the doctor explained, was based on the signs and symptoms Donald experienced without finding another cause. True confirmation, however, only comes from a brain sample showing something called spongiform brain tissue: small holes throughout the brain that make it look spongy. The family was upset for not noticing the signs earlier, but the doctor reminded them that nothing would have altered the course of the disease. It is a very rare disease that can take decades to show up after exposure, so it isn’t the first thing clinicians think of when they see someone with Donald’s symptoms. The doctor assured the family that they did nothing wrong. In fact, Michael should be proud for taking such good care of his grandfather in his final year of life.'
