        "transcript":'In this concept coach, we’ll explore DNA replication. All cells perform DNA replication before they divide. This ensures that each new daughter cell gets a copy of the genetic instructions essential for life. This process is so fast and accurate, it’s like copying someone’s notes at 500 words per minute and only making one mistake every 10 billion words!<br><br>DNA has two strands that pair up to make a twisted ladder, like the helical structure shown here in purple. <br><br>In bacteria, DNA is usually organized into a single, circular chromosome that folds in on itself in the nucleoid region of the cell.  <br><br>DNA replication begins when primosomes bind to a specific site in the bacterial chromosome, called the origin of replication.<br><br>The primosome is a collection of factors, including helicase and primase, which are enzymes we’ll review later.<br><br>As the DNA unwinds, a bubble forms. Next, other factors that are needed for replication are recruited to the bubble, and replication forks develop.<br><br>It is at these replication forks where DNA replication occurs.<br><br>As the new daughter DNA strands are built at the replication forks, the forks advance in opposite directions.<br><br>Because the bacterial chromosome is circular, the replication forks will eventually meet, and the two completed chromosomes will separate from each other.<br><br>Now let’s zoom in on a replication fork and see how DNA is copied.<br><br>As previously stated, the primosome that was recruited to the origin of replication is a complex of factors, including helicase and primase. <br><br>First, the helicase unwinds the DNA, and then tiny single-strand binding proteins attach to the DNA to keep the strands separated until they’re copied. <br><br>Next, primase builds short RNA segments, called RNA primers, to jump-start replication. DNA polymerase III, the main DNA copying enzyme, is then recruited to the complex. It builds DNA by adding nucleotides to the ends of RNA primers. DNA polymerase III can only build DNA in one direction.  <br><br>Starting at the RNA primer, the polymerase builds new DNA in the five-prime to three-prime direction and stops when it runs into the next RNA primer, or when it reaches the end of the DNA strand being copied. <br><br>You may have noticed that the process on the left strand of this figure looks simpler than what’s going on at the strand on the right. Let’s explore why.<br><br>The two strands of the DNA double helix are antiparallel. This means that the leading strand, shown on the left, is copied in the same direction as the helix is unwinding. The lagging strand, seen on the right, is built in the opposite direction of the unwinding helix. Let’s first look at how DNA is copied on the leading strand.<br><br>The leading strand is built in a continuous process that advances in the same direction as the helix is unwinding. To get started, DNA polymerase III latches onto an RNA primer that was previously laid down by primase at the origin. The polymerase then builds onto the primer by adding nucleotides complementary to the parent DNA template. Incoming nucleotides are added in a five-prime to three-prime manner. Replication terminates or ends when the polymerase reaches the end of the DNA strand being copied.<br><br>Synthesis of the lagging strand is more complex, because the new DNA is made in a discontinuous process in the opposite direction from that in which the helix is unwinding. On the lagging strand, chunks of DNA called Okazaki fragments are made and then glued together. These Okazaki fragments are made by several enzymes. <br><br>First, primase makes many RNA primers at intervals along the parent DNA strand. Next, DNA polymerase III latches to an RNA primer and builds onto it, generating a complementary DNA strand. When DNA polymerase III reaches the next primer, it falls off, but it can hop back onto another RNA primer and repeat the process elsewhere on the strand.<br><br>DNA polymerase I then replaces RNA primers in the lagging strand with DNA. This enzyme also works on the single RNA primer of the leading strand.<br><br>In the final step, the enzyme ligase glues the Okazaki fragments together, creating an uninterrupted DNA strand. Ligase also works where the single RNA primer was replaced in the leading strand.<br><br>As replication ends, we’re left with two separate but identical chromosomes. Each chromosome contains an original parent DNA strand and a newly made daughter DNA strand. By the end of cell division, these copies end up in separate cells.<br><br>An understanding of DNA replication has helped medical scientists develop treatments for various microbial illnesses such as chickenpox and herpes, as well as certain cancers.'

        "transcript":'In this concept coach, we learn how proteins are made. Protein synthesis is so important to cells that they die without it. Many antibiotics kill bacteria by blocking their protein synthesis.<br><br>Protein synthesis occurs in two stages, transcription and translation. The first stage of protein synthesis, transcription, involves making RNA from a DNA template. You can think of it as writing down a sentence that your teacher said--you aren’t changing the information, you’re just changing its form.<br><br>In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, while in prokaryotic cells, it’s in the cytoplasm.<br><br>Three main types of RNA are made by transcription: messenger RNA (also called mRNA), transfer RNA (also known as tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (abbreviated as rRNA). All three of these RNAs have roles in protein synthesis.<br><br>Messenger RNA is a linear molecule that carries the genetic message from DNA to ribosomes. The information in mRNA is stored in codons, which are groups of three consecutive nucleotides that code for amino acids or stop signals.<br><br>Transfer RNA, the cloverleaf-shaped molecule shown here, has a top portion that bonds to a specific amino acid and a lower part containing an anticodon. The anticodon of a tRNA molecule pairs with a complementary codon in mRNA to ensure that the correct amino acid is added as ribosomes build proteins.<br><br>Ribosomal RNA folds into three-dimensional structures that combine with proteins to make ribosomes.<br><br>Let’s now look more closely at how RNA is made by transcription.<br><br>To begin protein synthesis, the cell must first carry out transcription. In transcription, the DNA of a specific gene guides the production of RNA. Although transcription makes all three kinds of RNA that we reviewed earlier, here we follow the production of mRNA, which is the type of RNA that encodes proteins.<br><br>Transcription starts when RNA polymerase, the enzyme that builds RNA, binds to the promoter--a region at the beginning of a gene in DNA. RNA polymerase builds mRNA by laying down ribonucleotides that are complementary to the DNA. Recall that in RNA, uracil replaces thymine, so we will see A-U pairs in transcription instead of the A-T pairs that we saw in DNA replication. G and C still pair with each other in transcription just as they did in DNA replication.<br><br>Once RNA polymerase reaches the gene’s end, a termination sequence signals the RNA polymerase to fall off the gene and release the new mRNA transcript. In prokaryotes, the mRNA is immediately translated by ribosomes. However, in eukaryotes, mRNA is processed before translation.<br><br>Only certain parts of mRNA, called exons, code for proteins. Introns are parts of mRNA that don’t code for proteins and must be removed by a complex in the nucleus called the spliceosome. Processed eukaryotic mRNA then leaves the nucleus and heads to a ribosome.<br><br>Translation is the second stage of protein synthesis. In translation, cells convert the language of nucleic acids to that of proteins, just as we translate between a foreign language and our own.<br><br>In translation, the mRNA made earlier by transcription is read by ribosomes to build a protein. Translation is divided into three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.<br><br>Initiation occurs when a ribosome attaches to an mRNA and encounters a start codon. This start codon recruits an initiator tRNA that carries the amino acid methionine to the ribosome’s P site.<br><br>The protein is elongated as the next charged tRNA shuttles its amino acid into the ribosome. The tRNA matches its anticodon with the mRNA codon in the ribosome’s A site.<br><br>Provided the codon and anticodon are properly paired, the ribosome forms a peptide bond between the amino acid in the ribosome’s A site and the amino acid in the P site.<br><br>As the ribosome shifts, or translocates, to the next codon, the uncharged tRNA, which no longer carries an amino acid, leaves the ribosome via the E site.<br><br>This cycle of tRNAs shuttling amino acids to the ribosome continues until the ribosome finally reaches a stop codon. The stop codon signals the termination of translation. Once a stop codon is reached, a termination factor enters the ribosome, the newly made protein is released, and the ribosome detaches from the mRNA.<br><br> Protein synthesis requires a lot of energy to occur. Therefore, cells carefully regulate this process and only perform it when necessary. There are many ways to control protein synthesis.<br><br>Pre-transcriptional regulation occurs before transcription and therefore allows cells to regulate how much mRNA is made from a gene. Alternatively, protein synthesis can be controlled post transcriptionally by regulating how often mRNA is translated to build proteins.<br><br>Operons are an example of pre-transcriptional regulation tools. These collections of genes in DNA participate in achieving a joint goal, such as building or breaking down specific substances. The genes in an operon are controlled by a shared regulatory element.<br><br>Some operons are inducible, meaning they are not expressed unless certain conditions arise to turn them on--much like dark conditions could induce you to turn on a light. The lactose operon of <i>E. coli</i> works this way. The genes of the lac operon are transcribed only when lactose is present and the cell’s preferred sugar, glucose, is absent.<br><br>In contrast, repressible operons, such as the arginine operon of <i>E. coli</i>, are by default on--meaning the genes in the operon are actively transcribed until they are switched off, or repressed. Repressible operons help cells avoid making an already abundant product.<br><br>Protein synthesis is also regulated post transcriptionally. One example includes tiny fragments of RNA called small, noncoding RNAs. These limit protein synthesis by blocking ribosomes from translating mRNA.<br><br> Understanding protein synthesis and its regulation has helped medical scientists develop new antibiotics, stop biofilms from clogging mechanical heart valves, and limit cancer progression.<br><br>'
